## Welcome to my Digital Imager project

After 40 years working as a sofware engineer I'm keen to persue my old hobbies of Astronomy and instrument making. What better place to start than building a camera for a telescope.

### Nothing new here

There are a number of groups around the world who are developing their own cameras for use in Astronomy. The first part of this project will be a *state of the art survey* to identify those individuals and groups that have taken on projects of this kind. 

### Then what?

Lets see if we can make a contribution to one or more of these projects, provide some innovation and have some fun with electronics, software and metalwork along the way.
