# Analogue to digital converter

The Analogue to digital converter (ADC) component is responsible for converting the signal output by the CCD into a digital format
suitable for storage a processing on a computer. 

Our is based on the [AD9826](https://www.analog.com/media/en/technical-documentation/data-sheets/AD9826.pdf) chip. A video
signal processor developed by Sony. This ADC can operate at a rate of 15MSPS at a resolution of 16 bits. With this chip we sould
be able to achieve a readout time of less than 10 seconds for even the lagest of sensors that we might employ in this project.
